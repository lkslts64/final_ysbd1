COMPILATION:

instructor's main:	$ make findex
our main:			$ make findex2

RUN:

instructor's main:	$ ./findex arg1 arg2
our main:			$ ./findex2

CHECK RESULTS: 

(only for instructor's main):	$ cat results.txt

SPECS:

	- attrLength is exactly the length of the attrName string (both for 
	  HT_info and SHT_info).
	
	- offset is member of HT_info (and SHT_info) and it stores the offset
	  from start (of block zero) to first bucket.
	
					Block 0
					-------------
					|			|	
					|			|	
					|	info	|	offset = size of info at disk.

	- maxRecords member in SecondaryBlock and Block is not used at all.
	
	- Universal Hash is used (inspired from Wikipedia).
	
	- in HashStatistics(), we define overflow_blocks as the blocks that
	  have recordsCounter == MAX_RECORDS.
	
	- TEST MAIN: Our test_main creates two secondary indexes with keys
	  surname and address and it behaves similar to the instructor's
	  main (test_main.c).
